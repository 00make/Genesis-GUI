# Genesis GUI Development

A collaborative project to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the Genesis simulation framework.

## Overview

This GUI aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for Genesis, allowing users to:

- Edit and run Genesis simulation code
- Manage robotic arm simulations
- Visualize simulation results in real-time

## Key Features

- Interactive code editor with syntax highlighting
- Live simulation controls (Run/Pause)
- Dynamic robot manipulation (Add/Remove arms)
- Real-time simulation visualization window
- Built with Python and Tkinter

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Genesis Framework
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genesis-gui.git
